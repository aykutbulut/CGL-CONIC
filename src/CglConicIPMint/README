This is a cut generator for Second Order Cone Optimization problems.

It generates cut for a linear solver interface. Conic constraints are
given as inputs. It generates linear constraints that cuts the current
solution.

This cut generator is for an integer feasible but conic infeasible solution.
It fixes the integer variables and solves the problem for continuous variables.
We generate cuts from the binding conic constraints.
