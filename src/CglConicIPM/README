This is a cut generator for Second Order Cone Optimization problems.

It generates cut for a linear solver interface. Conic constraints are
given as inputs. It generates linear constraints that cuts the current
solution.

This is done by solving a SOCO optimization problem with IPM method. Moreover
the procedure also approximates the conic constraint around the IPM solution
found.
